# CNN-Implementation-for-MNIST-Digit-Recognition
we aim to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. We will implement the network architecture, including convolutional layers with ReLU activation, max pooling, and fully connected layers followed by a softmax activation function.
